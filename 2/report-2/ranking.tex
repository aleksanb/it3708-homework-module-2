\section{Problem difficulty ranking}

Ranked from easiest to hardest:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{One-max problem.} This is a simple hill-climbing problem where local maxima are a non-issue. Anything that exerts selection pressure is incredibly effective.

\item \emph{Local surprising sequence for s=9.} A harder problem than One-max, though by only caring about neighboring sequences the complexity is kept relatively low. Mutating a single character can at most introduce two new errors.

\item \emph{Global surprising sequence for S=9.} A single mutation can now introduce multiple errors, leading to higher complexity. Mutations can introduce multiple errors.

\end{enumerate}
