\section{Modified bit vector}
\label{sec:modified-vector}

Changing the target vector from all ones to a random bitvector poses only a minor jump required computational power. This due to the fact that the fitness function now has to calculate the delta between two vectors, instead of naively summing the ones. 

When finding a random bitvector of length 40, tournament selection used 10.96 generations average for 100 runs (1.67 std), in line with results from finding a bit vector of all ones. An example run is included in figure \ref{fig:random-tournament}
